Tmt
TMT steel, short for Thermo Mechanically Treated steel, is a type of high-strength steel that has been engineered with advanced properties. It is renowned for its exceptional weldability, strength, ductility, and bendability, which exceed international quality standards. TMT steel is considered a new-generation material that offers superior performance characteristics, making it a popular choice for a wide range of applications.

These provide the needed sturdiness for the building structures and ensure their longevity.
◎The thermo-mechanical treatment helps in toughening the crust of the outer steel and leaving the inner core incredibly soft to provide strength along with ductility and bendability.
◎ These are manufactured through 2 different routes of manufacturing which define the category of TMT bars, namely Primary and Secondary TMT.

Annealed wire, commonly known as binding wire, is a crucial material used in the construction industry for tying applications. Its primary purpose is to securely fasten the rebars at the joints, ensuring structural integrity. Made from mild steel, binding wire is an essential component that helps keep the construction elements firmly bound together.
